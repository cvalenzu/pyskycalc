This runs under python3 and obviously requires a recent astropy, numpy, and so on. The jupyter notebook should give a good idea of the functionality available.

pyskycalc3 is a GUI interface builton Tkinter and python image libraries.  It has an incomplete interface to ds9 that requires the XPA interface, which is available from the same site as ds9.
